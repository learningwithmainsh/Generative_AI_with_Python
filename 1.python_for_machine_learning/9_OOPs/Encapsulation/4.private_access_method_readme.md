# Private Methods in Python

## Overview
In Python, private methods are methods that are intended to be used only within a class and not accessed directly from outside the class. While Python does not enforce strict access control like some other programming languages (e.g., Java, C++), it follows a naming convention to indicate that a method is private.

## Naming Convention for Private Methods
Private methods in Python are prefixed with a double underscore `__` (two underscores). This triggers name mangling, which makes it harder (but not impossible) to access the method outside the class.

## Example
```python
class Example:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def __private_method(self):
        print(f"Hello, {self.name}! This is a private method.")
    
    def public_method(self):
        print("This is a public method.")
        self.__private_method()  # Calling the private method inside the class

# Usage
obj = Example("Manish")
obj.public_method()

# Trying to access private method directly (will raise an AttributeError)
# obj.__private_method()
```

## Name Mangling
Python performs name mangling on private methods, renaming `__private_method` to `_ClassName__private_method`. This means the method can still be accessed using:

```python
obj._Example__private_method()  # Not recommended, but works
```

## When to Use Private Methods
- To encapsulate helper methods that should not be accessed directly.
- To prevent accidental modification or misuse.
- To indicate that the method is for internal use within the class.

## Conclusion
Private methods in Python rely on naming conventions rather than strict access control. While they can still be accessed using name mangling, it is best practice to treat them as internal to the class and not access them directly from outside.
