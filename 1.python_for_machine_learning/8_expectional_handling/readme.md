# Python Expectation Handling

Expectation handling in Python involves managing errors, validating assumptions, and ensuring robustness in applications. This guide covers key techniques such as assertions, exception handling, and best practices.

## 1. Assertions

Assertions are used to validate conditions during development and debugging. They help catch logical errors early.

```python
assert condition, "Error message"
```

Example:
```python
def divide(a, b):
    assert b != 0, "Denominator must not be zero"
    return a / b
```

## 2. Exception Handling

Python provides `try-except` blocks to handle runtime errors gracefully.

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except ExceptionType as e:
    # Handling exception
else:
    # Executes if no exception occurs
finally:
    # Executes regardless of an exception
```

Example:
```python
def safe_divide(a, b):
    try:
        result = a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        result = None
    finally:
        print("Execution completed")
    return result
```

## 3. Custom Exceptions

Custom exceptions help define specific error conditions.

```python
class CustomError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message):
        super().__init__(message)
```

Example:
```python
def validate_age(age):
    if age < 0:
        raise CustomError("Age cannot be negative")
    return f"Valid age: {age}"
```

## 4. Using `warnings` Module

The `warnings` module is useful for non-critical issues.

```python
import warnings

warnings.warn("This is a warning message", UserWarning)
```

## 5. Best Practices

- Use assertions for debugging, not for runtime checks.
- Catch specific exceptions rather than using a general `except` block.
- Use custom exceptions for domain-specific error handling.
- Log errors instead of printing them for better debugging.
- Use the `warnings` module for non-critical issues.

## Conclusion

Handling expectations in Python ensures code reliability and maintainability. By using assertions, exception handling, and best practices, developers can build robust applications with proper error management.
