    "# Variables in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a variable is a name assigned to a value for storing and manipulating data during program execution. This document provides an overview of variables in Python, including their naming rules, types, and scopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Names\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variable names can be short (e.g., `x`, `y`) or descriptive (e.g., `age`, `car_name`, `total_volume`).\n",
    "- Must start with a letter or an underscore (`_`).\n",
    "- Can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.\n",
    "- Are case-sensitive (e.g., `Age` and `age` are different variables).\n",
    "- Cannot use Python keywords (e.g., `if`, `else`, `while`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Valid variable names\n",
    "name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "_age = 25\n",
    "total_volume = 100.5\n",
    "\n",
    "# Invalid variable names\n",
    "1name = \"Bob\"  # Starts with a number\n",
    "my-name = \"Charlie\"  # Contains a hyphen\n",
    "class = \"Physics\"  # Uses a reserved keyword\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python variables do not require explicit type declarations. The type is inferred from the assigned value. Common data types include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Numbers**: `int`, `float`, `complex`\n",
    "- **Strings**: Text values\n",
    "- **Lists**: Ordered, mutable collections\n",
    "- **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable collections\n",
    "- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Different types of variables\n",
    "number = 10         # Integer\n",
    "decimal = 10.5      # Float\n",
    "text = \"Hello\"      # String\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3] # List\n",
    "person = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}  # Dictionary\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Scopes\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports different types of variables based on their scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global Variables\n",
    "- Declared outside functions.\n",
    "- Accessible both inside and outside of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "global_var = \"I am global\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def example_function():\n",
    "    print(global_var)\n",
    "\n",
    "example_function()  # Output: I am global\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Variables\n",
    "- Declared inside functions.\n",
    "- Accessible only within the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def example_function():\n",
    "    local_var = \"I am local\"\n",
    "    print(local_var)\n",
    "\n",
    "example_function()  # Output: I am local\n",
    "# print(local_var)  # Error: local_var is not defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance Variables\n",
    "- Belong to individual instances of a class.\n",
    "- Unique to each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Variables\n",
    "- Shared by all instances of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Example:\n",
    "    class_var = \"I am a class variable\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.instance_var = value\n",
    "\n",
    "obj1 = Example(\"Instance 1\")\n",
    "obj2 = Example(\"Instance 2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "print(obj1.instance_var)  # Output: Instance 1\n",
    "print(obj2.instance_var)  # Output: Instance 2\n",
    "print(Example.class_var)  # Output: I am a class variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- Variables in Python are flexible and do not require explicit type declarations.\n",
    "- Follow naming conventions to ensure code clarity and maintainability.\n",
    "- Understand the scope of variables to prevent unintended behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy coding!\n"

    "# Python Variable Naming Rules and Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "When naming variables in Python, it is important to follow certain rules to ensure code clarity and prevent errors. Below are the guidelines for naming variables in Python, along with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules for Variable Names\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with a letter or underscore:**\n",
    "   Variable names must start with a letter or the underscore character (`_`).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   valid_variable = 42\n",
    "   _hidden_variable = \"secret\"\n",
    "   invalid-variable = 99  # This will cause an error\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No numbers at the beginning:**\n",
    "   Variable names cannot start with a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   1variable = 10  # Invalid\n",
    "   variable1 = 20  # Valid\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Only alpha-numeric characters and underscores:**\n",
    "   Variable names can only contain alpha-numeric characters (`A-z`, `0-9`) and underscores (`_`).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   user_name = \"Alice\"  # Valid\n",
    "   user-name = \"Bob\"    # Invalid\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Case-sensitive:**\n",
    "   Variable names are case-sensitive, so `age`, `Age`, and `AGE` are treated as three different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   age = 25\n",
    "   Age = 30\n",
    "   print(age)  # Outputs: 25\n",
    "   print(Age)  # Outputs: 30\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No spaces:**\n",
    "   Variable names should not contain spaces. Use underscores (`_`) to separate words instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   user_age = 25  # Valid\n",
    "   user age = 25  # Invalid\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Avoid Python keywords:**\n",
    "   Variable names cannot conflict with any Python keywords, such as `for`, `True`, `False`, `if`, or `else`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for = 10  # Invalid\n",
    "   my_for = 10  # Valid\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   To see a list of Python keywords, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import keyword\n",
    "   print(keyword.kwlist)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Mnemonics:**\n",
    "   Variable names should be mnemonic, meaning they should indicate the intent of their use.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   user_count = 100  # Clear and meaningful\n",
    "   uc = 100          # Ambiguous\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Underscores for private variables:**\n",
    "   Leading underscores (`_`) in variable names indicate that the attribute or function is private (used in class definitions).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Example:\n",
    "       def __init__(self):\n",
    "           self._private_var = 42\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Avoid one-character variable names:**\n",
    "   One-character variable names should be avoided, except for temporary variables in loops or mathematical contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Avoid:\n",
    "   x = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Prefer:\n",
    "   user_age = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Temporary variables (acceptable):\n",
    "   for i in range(5):\n",
    "       print(i)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these rules, you can ensure that your Python code is clear, maintainable, and less prone to errors.\n"
