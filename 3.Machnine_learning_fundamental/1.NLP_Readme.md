## Prerequisites
Before diving into NLP, it is essential to have a foundational understanding of:
- **Python** (basic syntax, data structures, functions)
- **Probability & Statistics** (Bayes' theorem, distributions, statistical inference)
- **Linear Algebra** (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues/eigenvectors)
- **Machine Learning Basics** (classification, regression, overfitting/underfitting)
- **Regular Expressions (RegEx)** (pattern matching, tokenization)

---

## NLP Core Concepts
- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into words or subwords
- **Stopwords Removal**: Filtering out common words like "the", "is", "and"
- **Stemming & Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their root forms
- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Identifying nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Detecting entities such as names, locations, dates
- **Syntax Parsing**: Analyzing sentence structure

---

## Vector Representation
- **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Representing text as word frequency vectors
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Weighing terms by importance
- **Word Embeddings**:
  - **Word2Vec** (CBOW, Skip-gram)
  - **GloVe** (Global Vectors for Word Representation)
  - **FastText** (Facebook's extension of Word2Vec with subword information)
- **Contextual Embeddings**:
  - **ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models)**
  - **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**
  - **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**

---

## NLP Tools and Libraries
- **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit)
- **spaCy** (Fast NLP processing)
- **Scikit-learn** (Text preprocessing, feature extraction, ML models)
- **Gensim** (Topic modeling, Word2Vec)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (Deep learning models for NLP)
- **PyTorch** (Transformer-based models like BERT, GPT, T5)
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (Pre-trained NLP models and pipelines)

---

## Intermediate Techniques
- **Sequence Models**: RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs for handling sequential data
- **Attention Mechanism**: Used in Transformers for capturing context efficiently
- **Transformers**: BERT, GPT, T5, XLNet for state-of-the-art NLP performance
- **Transfer Learning in NLP**: Fine-tuning pre-trained models
- **Text Augmentation**: Back-translation, synonym replacement, text paraphrasing
- **Handling Imbalanced Data**: Oversampling, undersampling, SMOTE

---

## NLP Tasks
- **Text Classification**: Sentiment analysis, spam detection
- **Machine Translation**: English to French, German to Spanish, etc.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extracting entities like names, dates, places
- **Question Answering**: Chatbots, automated answering systems
- **Summarization**: Extractive and abstractive text summarization
- **Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech**: Voice assistants, transcription services
- **Text Generation**: Story generation, code autocompletion
- **Semantic Search**: Finding relevant documents, contextual search
